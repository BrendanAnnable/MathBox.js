MathBox (undocumented, work in progress)
==========

![MathBox](https://raw.github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/master/resources/example.png)

MathBox is a library for rendering presentation-quality math diagrams in a browser using WebGL. Built on top of Three.js and tQuery, it provides a clean API to visualize mathematical relationships and animate them smoothly.

MathBox can be operated manually using a tQuery-like API, or used in presentation mode with the included Director. This lets you to feed in a script of actions and step through them one by one, generating an automatic 'rollback' script to allow you to step backwards.

MathBox was initially created for the conference talk "Making Things with Maths" at [Full Frontal 2012](http://2012.full-frontal.org) and is still a work in progress. There are a couple of important functionality gaps, such as a complete lack of axis and point labelling and inability to re-use styles consistently.

Browser support is currently limited to Google Chrome, which should be rectified as soon as I manage to catch up on sleep.
